# Scheduling and Orchestration

This section provides an overview of the scheduling and orchestration mechanisms used in IronCore's Infrastructure as 
a Service (IaaS) layer. It covers the concepts of `Pools`, poollets, and the IronCore Runtime Interface (IRI), 
which together enable efficient resource management and allocation.

## Pools and Classes

The core concept in IronCore's scheduling architecture is the resource `Pool`. A `Pool` is announced by a poollet which represents
an entity onto which resources can be scheduled. The announcement of a `Pool` resource is done by a poollet, which 
also provides in the `Pool` status the `AvailableMachineClasses` a `Pool` supports. A `Class` in this context represents 
a list of resource-specific capabilities that a `Pool` can provide, such as CPU, memory, and storage.

`Pools` and `Classes` are defined for all major resource types in IronCore, including compute, storage. Resources in the 
`networking` API have no `Pool` concept, as they are not scheduled but rather provided on-demand by the network related
components. The details are described in the [networking section](/iaas/architecture/networking).

An example definition of a `Pool` from the `compute` API group (`MachinePool`) is shown below:

```yaml
apiVersion: compute.ironcore.dev/v1alpha1
kind: MachinePool
metadata:
  name: machinepool-sample
spec:
  providerID: ironcore://shared
status:
  availableMachineClasses:
    - name: machineclass-sample
```

The corresponding `MachineClass` defines the capabilities of the pool, such as CPU and memory:

```yaml
apiVersion: compute.ironcore.dev/v1alpha1
kind: MachineClass
metadata:
  name: machineclass-sample
capabilities:
  cpu: 4
  memory: 16Gi
```

## Scheduling

If a `Machine` or `Volume` resource has been created, the IronCore scheduler will look for a suitable `Pool` which
supports the defined `MachineClass` or `VolumeClass`. If a suitable `Pool` is found, the scheduler will set the `.spec.machinePoolRef` 
or `.spec.volumePoolRef` field of the `Machine` or `Volume` resource to the name of the `Pool`. This reference indicates
the `poollet` responsible for the announced `Pool` that something needs to be done, such as creating a `Machine` or `Volume` resource.

The currrent schedule implementation works on a best-effort basis, meaning that it will try to find a suitable `Pool` and
assign the correct `Pool` but it does not guarantee that the `Machine` or `Volume` will be created. A new `Reservation` 
based scheduling mechanism which is described in this [enhancement proposal](https://github.com/ironcore-dev/ironcore/blob/main/docs/proposals/11-scheduling.md)
should provide a more robust scheduling mechanism in the future.

## Poollets 

The `poollets` responsibilities besides announcing the `Pool` are manifold and are depicted in the diagram below:

1. **Ensuring prerequisites are met**: In the example of a `Machine`, the creation of a `Machine` should only be 
   proceeded with, if e.g. the root `Volume` of the `Machine` is available. 
2. **Resource Creation**: The `poollet` is responsible for creating the actual resources in the underlying infrastructure, such as 
   virtual machines or storage volumes.
3. **Status Propagation**: The `poollet` updates the status of the `Machine` resource (e.g. `Running`, `Failed`, etc.) based on the 
   state of the underlying resources it manages.

The key role in managing the resources is defined in the [IronCore Runtime Interface (IRI)](/iaas/architecture/runtime-interface), 
which provides a well-defined gRPC interface for each resource group. 

This architecture with resoruces scheduled on `Pools` and `poollets` acting as the resource managers by invoking a backend
interface API corresponds to the same model Kubernetes is using with Kubelet announcing `Nodes` and `Pods` being scheduled
on `Nodes`. The Kubelet here interact via the Container Runtime Interface (CRI) with the container runtime, to manifest 
the actual instance of a `Pod`.
